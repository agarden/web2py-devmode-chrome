web2py has no development mode. Production or development, it logs all
exceptions to its internal ticket system and to the user displays an
error page with a link to the ticket. I got tired of clicking the ticket
links and waiting for them to load, so I wrote this little Chrome
extension that creates an iframe and opens them there for me. The result:
much faster debugging during web2py development.
