# Web2py Browser Extensions
web2py has no development mode. Production or development, it logs all exceptions to its internal ticket system and to the user displays an error page with a link to the ticket. 

Are you tired of clicking the ticket links and waiting for them to load, then these browser extensions are for you - Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox extension. 
The extension creates an iframe and opens the ticket in there. 
The result: **much faster debugging during web2py development.**
